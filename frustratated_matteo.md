While within these pages I will try to keep it going about **Casino Dog** technical stuff for biggest part, it's why the blog part of these pages I will fill with all little scams & drama's around the fraud.

The public naming & shaming is inherent to the fact these people have went to lengths as to threaten family members, insult family members, try to steal monies from me, posting my address around, impersonating my friends to me and even to the point where they have been fake crying as a fake customer after shutting down my business.

Not to mention I've been shafted myself out of hundreds of thousands of missed revenue due to fact having to pause any growth last 8-10 months. On top of that these same guys who've been fake crying (actually fake crying) seem to turn like leaflet on a tree to then say they are driving lamborghini's of all the stolen cash (I doubt it, as these are just dogs to the big people, but still).

Simply cause as the "small guy" and not accepting the fraudsters also using some of my game aggregation for their criminal practices, what I did "_wrong_" is to ask them to leave my services. 

<!-- DESCRIPTION_END -->

## Frustrated Matteo

Probably being the first person ever to say `no` to them, this must have invoked somekind of childhood trauma for them or anything, as the result of simply asking to leave (and that would've been the end of it) seemed to be a thing that was impossible to accept for this bunch of squidward criminals and he literally said about how even all that stuff was true, I should just look other way and earn few bucks and he literally said the words he was a "_honest_" businessman.

To summarize, it meant that my request to leave my legit service alone with their frauds, and it fell on deaf ears, as afterwards ex-customer Matteo Di Matteo (afterwards I find out he is responsible of [MondoGaming.eu](https://mondogaming.eu), [WhiteHatGaming.com](https://whitehatgaming.com), [RubyPlay.eu](https://rubyplay.eu) are his 'honestman' attempts while he is directly also responsible for infingaming (argo: playson, booongo)). 

This was also the first big breakthrough, as looking into this Matteo Di Matteo, after already being pushed out pretty much out of business and around my 4-5th pc I bought (I think now the count is around 15-18 PC's though have given up to go against billions of $ and thousands of affilliated dogs that will do anything to bring a smile to their master's face), I was able to get access to all files/systems of slotmachine abuse by [EveryMatrix](https://everymatrix.net). 

Which naturally as they are breaking the law is openly published for all of you guys, also it gives insight to each provider and can be reviewed at [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/A7pTAIxQ#RKFqwEkJU1f0DxGaaKXk_Q).

You can download the transaction database of EveryMatrix in parts [here](). The first part is around 200GB of transactions, the other 800GB I will upload through out the coming weeks bit by bit (just a lot of data to transfer).

It then wasn't long after was able to access also the sportsbook software from the guy, which can be seen at MondoGaming.eu but also is used for example on Playtech, AMBBet, and so on. 

While I had access, I have not touched one outcome or have stolen a penny from them (tbh as I figured, just look at 1xbet's payout complaints, they won't payout winners anyway).

The sportsbook software can be downloaded freely right here.

The interesting bit is that the amateuristic frontend is represented on it's backend, as the code is very very unsafe of any use (really even to use in staging probably is unsafe) which gives to wonder how this ever got approved by any gambling commission worldwide and the fact that a single guy (and I'm really just a scripter at best) got access within a day to these systems.

Anybody using google/urlscan could've gotten access to EveryMatrix/Playtech systems as presented. This also means that an ill-intended person out for money could've duped the unsuspecting casino operators that just wanted a sportsbook, or a few games. As even a single slot game already basically gives access to a casino's full treasury.
