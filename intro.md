**Wainwright's Casino Dog** is a tool to easily re-produce slotmachine frauds that are widely used within the legal casino-industry.


**For a name and shame** and to see the persons (that are confirmed to be real and existing as only putting those up that I've seen or heard in calls), click [here](#here). 

**List is most likely much bigger, as it is a labryrint of bullshit holdings.** In any case you should take care of any crypto casino ++ . As the providers are basically also the casino operators, there are some providers to take extra care for like [PlayNGo](https://playngo.com), [Pragmaticplay.com](https://pragmaticplay.com).


**Casino Dog** gives independent and free access to slotmachines of over 15+ game providers, and many to come. By default giving you access to over 2000 casino games.

**Casino Dog** is being worked on as hobby and to learn new tech skills, while a natural curosity to know how things are being made & done.

**Casino Dog** (actually it's just me on my own now) has no commercial activities going on, if this changes in future I will change this piece of text.

The reason this is hard to spot initially is because the game events are cleverly sent by either obfuscating with SWF standalone (flash-player, which can be loaded using html2swf), or they put it inside a PDF.

This is achieved by running up a virtual "console" within your browser. It's .js sources can be found at [https://static-0.herokuapp.com/c27-dir/commonStatic], also the favicon you will find in this and other sites you can simply decrypt to see how the content is pushed aside easily.

**In Casino Dog, while we replicate the game fraud, do not have access to generate sessions (usually). **
**This means that for the criminals below, working for the providers as dogs, thes e
